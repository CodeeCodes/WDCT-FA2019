# Day One Lecture Notes

## Web Development in a Nutshell

Internet is tightly integrated into our daily lives.

- Reading news, shopping, socializing and even researching and storing information.
- We use wide variety of devices to do our day to day task and to access information like smartphones, televisions, household appliances and computers.
- All these devices are connected to the Internet 24 \* 7
- **Web Development is the practice of creating technology that will be used through any device connected to the Internet**
- Web Development refers to skills and technologies that we use to create a website or web application. But it can also be used to create the most robust and powerful social network apps or banking websites using server technologies.
- Internet has evolved from a group of small of computers to world-wide computers and devices connected to each other.
- Information is viewed and shared using client/server model
- **Client** refers to part of your website that an end user can see and interact with.
- **Server** refers to part of your website that is not directly accessible by end user but is responsible for feeding user with the data/information that is to be viewed on the Client
- e.g. ATM - where the buttons/touchpad on ATM machine is client and internal machinery & storage for cash is server side.
- The 3 important building blocks or technologies essential to any website/application is HTML, CSS & Javascript.

## Internet v/s World Wide Web

Though Internet and Web are used interchangeably, they have different history and role to play in web development.

- **World Wide Web** was invented in 1989 as a way to share documents through world wide network of computers.
- This world wide network of computers is called **Internet**
- Invention of computers led to the idea of sharing information that spanned a single room, university campuses, countries and across oceans.
- In late 1960s, **Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)**, a US Military Organization developed ARPANET to create a network that would scale fast globally.
- The first message to sent by its creators was "log in".
- ARPANET was made more open and generic so that any new computer/network could join it.
- By 1980s, ARPANET and invention of email and chat led to the term Internet that we know today.

There were some major issues with Internet. To access some information, user had to beforehand know which machine to connect to, make sure he has required permissions to connect to that computer, search through entire storage of that computer and that the right program is installed to view that document.

Users usually found sharing documents over a coffee easier than going through this hassle.

Tim Berners Lee working back then at CERN in 1989 had an idea to simplify this process by

- using standardized document (**HTML**) that everyone can agree upon and having a computer program (**Browser**) to allow user to view the document.
- have a way to go from one computer to another using links provided in a document (HYPERLINKing)
- assign a unique address (**URL**) to each document so that it can accessed without knowing whose computer it's stored on.

-   floating is heavily used for page layout
-   by default block level elements take entire page width

-   try to comment out all color divs
-   remove float property of img
-   float img to left
-   float img to right

Float
-   remove comments around color divs
-   add/remove width from box class to see that block level elements take entire page width
-   try adding left and right float to color divs to see how float works

Clear Float
-   add a div with class boxes around all color divs
-   the div should have height of zero as floats are taken out of normal document flow and have no height and width occupied in normal document flow
-   add new content div below color boxes
-   add clear: both property to content div to see that floats are cleared before elements are rendered
-   try adding top margin.  It should take margin on top of the color divs
-   try adding a dummy div with style of clear:both.  Now margin should appear
-   This is not a good practice of coding.  Try adding pseudo property :after to clear floats

Text Columns
-   uncomment ".wrapper p" style.

Relative Positioning
-   Does not remove an element from normal document flow
-   Offsets are given using left, right, top, bottom
-   Usually used to tweak Positioning little bit here and there
-   Positioned relative to its position
-   Uncomment position:relative for box and all nth-child

Absolute Positioning
-   Removes the element from normal document flow
-   positioned absolutely relative of it's closest **POSITIONED** parent (usually has relative position)
-   Uncomment banner related css and html

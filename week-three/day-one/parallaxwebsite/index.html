        Vancouver has been ranked one of the most livable cities in the world
        for more than a decade. As of 2010, Vancouver has been ranked as having
        the fourth-highest quality of living of any city on Earth. In contrast,
        according to Forbes, Vancouver had the sixth-most overpriced real estate
        market in the world and was second-highest in North America after Los
        Angeles in 2007. Vancouver has also been ranked among Canada's most
        expensive cities in which to live. Sales in February 2016 were 56.3%
        higher than the 10-year average for the month. Forbes has also ranked
        Vancouver as the tenth-cleanest city in the world.

        Vancouver's scenic location makes it a major tourist destination. Over
        10.3 million people visited Vancouver in 2017. Annually, tourism
        contributes approximately $4.8 billion to the Metro Vancouver economy
        and supports over 70,000 jobs. Many visit to see the city's gardens,
        Stanley Park, Queen Elizabeth Park, VanDusen Botanical Garden and the
        mountains, ocean, forest and parklands which surround the city. Each
        year over a million people pass through Vancouver on cruise ship
        vacations, often bound for Alaska.
